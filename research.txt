 * Hook: 97% of runners ditch wired earbuds in the first week due to sweat & wire bounce

 * 6. Immediately after the hero image: big TITLE BANNER with
 *      — Huge <h1>
 *      — Sub-headline with social proof
 *      — Large prominent CTA button (use <a> styled as button)
 * 7. After benefits section: add a section with exactly 3 lifestyle/product images
 *      — Each image 800×800 (or 800×1000), lazy loading

 *
 * OUTPUT ONLY THESE 3 FILES with proper code fences and filenames:
 * • index.html     → full page with title banner + 3 images
 * • sitemap.xml    → valid XML
 * • robots.txt     → clean + sitemap reference
